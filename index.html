  <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>After spending the last <em>two decades</em> in the food service industry, I decided to pivot careers into the tech industry, thus leading me to <span class="awesome">Epicodus Bootcamp</span>. I've always found technology interesting and believe that it holds a lot of oppourtunity for people like.</p>
